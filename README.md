# mario4tier_dummy_repo

Hi mario4tier, I just want to contact you about TA-Lib but I can't see any public information to do so.

> The Plan
>
> Revive TA-Lib as a Rust package with Python bindings (using PyO3 Maturin). These two languages have mature tooling for packaging and portable distribution.
>
> There is hope that this will be easier to maintain by the community on long term.

> Contact mario4tier on github if interested.

Please, hit me up at denbro1@protonmail.com.

Thank you and sorry for the inconvenience.
